## About the Project

The goal of this project is to provide a tool to generate random price charts for various situations or trade tests. Initially created in 2019, this code was designed to test trade strategies by comparing random data with real asset prices. Through my experiments, I have found superficial proof supporting the theory of chaos in financial markets.

### Complexity and Noise Analysis

Financial markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to:

- Economic data
- News
- Investor sentiment
- Trading algorithms

This combination of variables introduces a level of complexity and noise, contributing to the chaotic nature of markets and making it challenging to predict future price movements accurately. This project aims to simulate that unpredictability for testing and analytical purposes.

### How to Use

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- R programming language installed on your system.

#### Generating Random Price Charts

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Open the `Random-Price-Chart.R` script in your R environment.

2. **Execute the Script:**
   - Run the script. It will generate a random price chart based on predefined parameters or algorithms within the script.

3. **View the Output:**
   - Upon completion, the script will save two files in the project directory:
     - A `.csv` file containing the data for the random price chart.
     - An `.html` file presenting the random price chart in an interactive format.

4. **Customize Parameters (Optional):**
   - You can modify the script to change the parameters of the random price generation, such as the number of data points, range, and type of distribution.

#### Notes

- Ensure your R environment is properly set up and can run scripts without issues.
- Check the script for any required packages and install them using R's package manager.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the script comments or documentation for guidance.
